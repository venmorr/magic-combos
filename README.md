**Next Steps**:
- 

- TAP! A system to "tap" combos you like so that you can save them for later in your "Tapped List."
- Detailed card view. Functionality allowing users to choose any card to take a closer look at to learn more about it.
- Mana color marks. Check boxes in the combo creation and edit process that allows you to choose which mana colors are included in the combo.
- I want to work on the mobile display for this app. It is pretty good already except for in the combo details area, the buttons overlap the description a bit.
- Live Price API: I think It would be really cool to find some way to display the price of these combos based on the current price of each of these cards.
